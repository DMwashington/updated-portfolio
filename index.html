                        My name is David Washington. I am currently studying to be a full stack web 
                        developer in Austin, TX. My education before this was in the medical field and 
                        I also spent time in the United States Army. I am enjoying learning how to code,
                        even though sometimes it can be challenging. I hope to know all that this 
                        course has to offer me by the time I complete it in June of 2019.
